class PatientsController < ApplicationController 

# 1. I need user/patients 
#     URLS 
#         Get /signup #=> see a form 
#         POST /users(patients) #=> to actually create the user 
#     database 
#         I need a users table to store their username and password

# 2. I need to give users/patients passwords
# 3. Then I need to make sure that I can find a user/patient with their actual password
# 4. change my login system to username and password to authenticate

# 1. Build my user registration process (signup form and signup creation)
# 2. give posts to users 
# 3. only let them edit posts they made 
  # clean up this page and also make sure the user can only see their prescriptions 
    #  i think i need a user route??? 
    #ive got my get and post signup and i need the same for my login then obviously 
    # a logout route which would just clear the session, after a user logs in and when 
    #they sign up i want to take them to their show page.... right??
